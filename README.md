TOAO-Ladder-Program
===================

A program that tracks relative skill of players in a gaming ladder, initially created to keep track of the relative skill between members of the TOAO Clan for Age of Empires II, members have also reported using it to help out communities wanting to rank their members in other games, such as Quake Live. The program uses a scoring system similar to Elo ratings, but much simpler, the math was thought up by the leaders of TOAO clan (who initially kept track of player ranks using a spreadsheet) and was implement by me in this program.

The program was built in flash using a suite called SWF Studio (www.northcode.com) in order to allow flash to write files to the disk (to save the data of the players), the program will not work compile through flash alone.

I have not worked on this project for quite some time although I would eventually like to port it to Java or a similar language in order to not have to depend on external programs to hack in the file I/O capabilities. A build of the latest version can be downloaded in the Build folder as a zip file.
