TOAO-Ladder-Program
===================

A program that tracks relative skill of players in a gaming ladder, initially created to keep track of the relative skill between members of the TOAO Clan for Age of Empires II, members have also reported using it to help out communities wanting to rank their members in other games, such as Quake Live. The program uses a scoring system similar to Elo ratings, but much simpler, the math was thought up by the leaders of TOAO clan (who initially kept track of player ranks using a spreadsheet) and was implement by me in this program.
